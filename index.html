          <div class="paragraph">
            <p> In November of 2022, the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) hosted a hybrid meeting to discuss a new cannabis equity program. An hour in, OCM opened the floor to public comment, inviting a random selection of cannabis lawyers and New Yorkers to step up to the mic at the front of the room. Ninth in line was 61-year-old New York City resident Ronald Schuller. Schuller’s comments were brief, but piercing.   </p>

            <p> “I went online to apply for the application, and I thought it was totally overwhelming, and that some of the criteria and some of the things that you needed were incomprehensible to me where I come from,” he said. </p>

            <p> Schuller, 61, was talking about the <a href="https://cannabis.ny.gov/conditional-adult-use-retail-dispensary"> Conditional Adult Use Retail Dispensary License program</a>, also known as the CAURD program. Announced in March 2022, as a part of New York State Governor Kathy Hochul’s <a href= "https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-office-cannabis-management-seeding-opportunity-initiative">Seeding Opportunity Initiative</a>, the program seeks to uplift those harmed by the War On Drugs by putting them at the front of the line for dispensary licenses. Over 900 people applied for 300 licenses in the 2022 fall round. So far, OCM has granted 215 licenses. According to Trivette Knowles, an OCM press officer, 62 percent have been given to minority and women-owned businesses.  </p>

            <p>“I think New York is taking a really big swing and we haven't seen this happen,” said <a href = "https://drugpolicy.org/melissa-moore">Melissa Moore</a>, the director of Civil Systems Reform at the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA). “In the first wave of states to legalize, people who are directly impacted were unfortunately excluded from even being able to be an employee at a dispensary much less actually own and operate a dispensary.”</p>

            <p> Despite the state’s meaningful attempts to advance social and economic equity through this program, the question still remains: Are CAURD licenses actually going to people who need them the most? With all of the requirements, the bar to obtain a license is quite high and for some, it may be completely out of reach. </p>

            <h2 class="heading"><u>"The Arrest Capital"</u></h2>
            <p class="top-p">In the 1990s, New York City became known as the <a href= "https://nymag.com/news/features/58995/">marijuana-arrest capital.</a> Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s intensive policing tactics like “Stop and Frisk” were particularly detrimental to Black and Latino communities. Over the years, Black people were consistently arrested at a higher rate than other racial groups. </p>

            <p>The data below shows the percentage of Black, White, Asian, and Latino people arrested for a marijuana-related conviction in New York City from 1990 to 2020. Our analysis of arrest data found that Black communities were disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs. </p>

            <div class="paragraph">
               <p> In order to address the harm caused by the War on Drugs, New York State launched a series of initiatives, including the CAURD program in 2022. The program came on the heels of the<a href="https://cannabis.ny.gov/marihuana-regulation-and-taxation-act-mrta "> Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act,” </a> (MRTA), the 2021 legislation that legalized adult-use cannabis in all of New York State. </p>

               <h2 class="heading"><u>Breaking Down The Application Process</u></h2>
               <p class="top-p">A closer reading of the fine print shows that this equity program may not be as accessible as advertised.</p>

               <p>If a previously convicted individual or their family wanted to apply for the CAURD program, the costs start racking up even before they submit the $2000 application, which does not guarantee one’s spot or raise their eligibility. Because the application process is complex, some opt to hire a lawyer to help them; this is where the additional costs come in. According to <a href = "https://www.davidfeldmanblog.com/">David Feldman</a>, a corporate lawyer and CEO at <a href="https://skipintroadvisors.com/">Skip Intro Advisors LLC</a>, a standard fee to complete a client’s CAURD application can cost up to $25,000. </p>

               <p>While there are regional hubs like <a href = "https://thebronxcannabishub.org/">Bronx Cannabis Hub</a> and the <a href="https://www.bronxdefenders.org/holistic-defense/"> Bronx Defenders</a> that help people with their applications, OCM does not have a centralized system to guide applicants through the process.</p>

               <p>Martine Aguiar, CEO of <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_fl/N03000001156">Women of a New Generation Inc</a>, who spoke at the same November OCM meeting as Schuller, noted that hiring a lawyer is not a viable option for some applicants. </p>

               <p>“As an affected individual and small nonprofit organization, it is already difficult to complete the application compared to other applicants who have attorneys completing their application and representing them at the public board meeting,” said Aguiar. “There is no equity when one application is professionally done by attorneys versus those done by individuals who can’t afford legal help.”</p>

               <p>In Moore’s opinion, the most difficult requirement for CAURD applicants is proving they have business experience. Candidates must show that they owned at least 10 percent of a qualifying business for two years. She states that some applicants may have run a cannabis business before the state legalized marijuana in 2021 but may be hesitant to use that experience on their application.</p>

               <p>“Folks that have a profitable legacy business might be able to come in, but there was still, unfortunately, the threat of potential federal enforcement if somebody were to disclose that,” said Moore.</p>

               <p>For Schuller, two years of business experience seemed like a lofty requirement, especially for people who are rebuilding their lives after incarceration. </p>

               <p>“You asked from me who has been to prison, been to jail, to have all of this experience without you taking me through the experience process and helping me to uplift myself to become a partner,” he said during the meeting.</p>

               <p>Another way to get your hand on a license is by applying through the nonprofit criteria. In order to qualify, a nonprofit needs to have at least one person with a former cannabis conviction or an affected relative – as a board member, officer, governing committee member or advising committee member. </p>

               <p>This is how Arana Hankin-Biggers, a 46-year-old with a background in real estate development and politics, managed to open the <a href="https://www.unionsquaretravelagency.com/">Union Square Travel Agency.</a> To gain access to a license, Hankin-Biggers created a new entity called Harbour Community LLC, which then partnered with the <a href="https://www.doe.org/"> Doe Fund</a>, a New York City nonprofit that gives formerly incarcerated men access to paid work and career training. The Doe Fund owns 51 percent of the business, and the newly created LLC owns 49 percent. </p>

              <br>

               <p>Partnerships like this are common, says Feldman. He has seen a lot of justice-involved individuals partnering with people who have access to capital, a setup he thinks will work well.</p>

               <p>“The 49 percent owner, besides also bringing access to capital, brings experience in the quote legal industry, whereas a lot of the justice-involved individuals are experienced in the legacy industry,” he said.</p>
               
               <h2 class="heading"><u>Big Dreams, Bigger Roadblocks</u></h2>
               <p class="top-p">When the state launched the CAURD program, Gov. Hochul proposed a $200 million fund for equity entrepreneurs to help get their businesses off the ground. The State would foot $50 million of the fund, and source the remaining $150 million from investors. They hired the <a href="https://www.dasny.org/">Dormitory State Authority of the State of New York (DASNY)</a> to oversee this fund and provide leasing services for CAURD applicants. However, eight months in, the fund hasn’t raised a single <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/marijuana/2023/02/new-yorks-political-leaders-silent-about-states-failure-to-raise-cannabis-funds.html">cent.</a> </p>

               <p>The OCM has also faced its own challenges. When the office <a href="https://cannabis.ny.gov/about-0#:~:text=About%20the%20Office%20of%20Cannabis%20Management&text=The%20New%20York%20State%20Office,the%20state%20of%20New%20York.">first opened in March 2021</a>, Moore says it wasn’t well-equipped to deliver on its promises.</p>

               <p>“OCM was operating with only a handful of staff, several quarters into their existence and [had] a lot of uphill challenges [from] creating an entire new agency from scratch at the state level and getting literal desks for people to sit at. And then people [to] fill those roles and actually sit at those desks,” said Moore.</p>

               <p>While operating with only a small team, the office has also had to manage 900 applications for their first CAURD program rollout and a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/nys-facing-first-lawsuit-over-retail-9144710/">lawsuit </a> that claims CAURD prefers in-state applicants over out-of-state applications.</p>

               <p>Overall, the process has a lot of slow-moving parts but OCM is still crawling ahead. </p>

               <p>“What we're doing is unconventional…and something never before seen in the country,” said Knowles. “So with that are going to come some new obstacles, some unforeseen challenges.”</p>
